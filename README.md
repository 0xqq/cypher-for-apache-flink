# CAPS: Cypher for Apache Spark

CAPS extends [Apache Spark™](https://spark.apache.org) with [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/), the industry's most widely used [property graph](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/blob/master/docs/property-graph-model.adoc) query language.
It allows for the **integration** of many **data sources** and supports **multiple graph** querying.
It enables you to use your Spark cluster to run **analytical graph queries**.
Queries can also return graphs to create **processing pipelines**.

## Intended audience

CAPS allows you to develop complex processing pipelines orchestrated by a powerful and expressive high-level language.
In addition to **developers** and **big data integration specialists**, CAPS is also of practical use to **data scientists**, offering tools allowing for disparate data sources to be integrated into a single graph. From this graph, queries can extract subgraphs of interest into new result graphs, which can be conveniently exported for further processing. In addition to traditional analytical techniques, the graph format enables you to use Cypher and *[Neo4j graph algorithms](https://neo4j.com/blog/efficient-graph-algorithms-neo4j/)* to derive deeper insights from your data.
<!-- TODO: WIKI How does it relate to GraphX and GraphFrames -->
<!--- **Data Analysts**: -->
<!--  This example shows how to aggregate detailed sales data within a graph — in effect, performing a ‘roll-up’ — in order to obtain a high-level summarized view of the data, stored and returned in another graph, as well as returning an even higher-level view as an executive report. The summarized graph may be used to draw further high-level reports, but may also be used to undertake ‘drill-down’ actions by probing into the graph to extract more detailed information.-->

## Current status: Alpha

The project is currently in an alpha stage, which means that the code and the functionality are still changing. We haven't yet tested the system with large data sources and in many scenarios. We invite you to try it and welcome any feedback.

## CAPS Features & Roadmap

CAPS supports a subset of Cypher <!-- TODO: WIKI supported features --> and is the first implementation of [multiple graphs](https://github.com/boggle/openCypher/blob/CIP2017-06-18-multiple-graphs/cip/1.accepted/CIP2017-06-18-multiple-graphs.adoc) and graph query compositionality.

CAPS currently supports importing graphs from both Neo4j and from CSV+HDFS.

We are planning to:
- Make CAPS easy to use as a Spark package
- Support more Cypher features
- Integrate with existing Spark libraries via the DataFrame API
- Support importing graphs from more external sources
- Offer a pluggable data source interface

## Getting started with CAPS

<!-- TODO: Publish to Maven Central -->
<!-- TODO: Steps needed to run the demo with toy data -->
<!-- TODO: Example in Notebook (Zeppelin?) -->
<!-- TODO: WIKI article that demonstrates a more realistic use case with HDFS data source -->
<!-- TODO: WIKI link to page that explains how to import data -->

## How to contribute

We'd love to find out about any issues you encounter. We welcome code contributions -- please open an [issue](https://github.com/neo-technology/cypher-for-apache-spark/issues) first to ensure there is no duplication of effort. <!-- TODO: Determine CLA and process -->
