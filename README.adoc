= Cypher on Spark experiment

Talk to the openCypher team if you have questions.

=== Setting it up on Spark

==== Neo4j

The benchmarks rely on pulling data from a running Neo4j server.
You'll need a `3.0.7` version of Neo4j, with all data loaded.
The `neo4j` needs to exist, and you need to supply the Neo4j password to the application.

==== Spark cluster

First, you need a Spark cluster set up.
So far, we've only been testing on `standalone` Spark clusters (one machine).
Spark is set up on `mattis` and `borka` in `/home/neo/openCypher/spark`.

To start Spark in standalone mode, run `sbin/start-master.sh` and `sbin/start-slave.sh <master address>` from the spark home directory.

==== Running the benchmarks

1. Build the JAR for this project `mvn clean package`.
** Upload the JAR to the machine that hosts the master, or do the necessary network management to deploy from your local machine.
3. Start the Spark master.
5. Submit the application to the Spark master.

.Example bash script for running the benchmarks (master address is the default for `mattis`).
[source, bash]

There are more configuration options to use; see the class `Configuration.scala`.
