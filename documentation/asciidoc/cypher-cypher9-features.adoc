= Supported Cypher

// TODO: Incorporate below spreadsheet here
// https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c5_LoI96EYICE6l09rxna-eLO7V-GParEdiHLJJ_Oaw/[This spreadsheet] tracks which aspects of Cypher are currently supported.

Not all functions and graph patterns are yet supported but all of the basics are in place.

Notably missing are:

* `shortestPath` and `allShortestPaths`
* path patterns (`p = ()-\->()`)
* unbounded variable-length patterns

Cypher 9 support will be increased over successive versions of CAPS.
